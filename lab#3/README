# Windows Programming Laboratory Work #3
## Subject
_Basics of Working with Mouse. GDI Primitives. Bezier Curve._

## Mandatory Objectives
- [x] Draw few lines of different colors and weights
- [x] Draw a Bezier curve
- [x] Draw few plane objects (ex. circle, square, pie, polygon...) of different colors, weights, filled and not
- [x] Draw 2 different objects using mouse

## Bonus Objectives

- [x] Draw a custom bitmap image (1 pt) 
- [x] Add a switch (button, select list...) that will change mouse ability to draw objects (2 pt)
- [x] Draw a Bezier curve using mouse (1 pt)
- [x] Fill an object with a gradient (1 pt)
- [ ] Delete objects using mouse clicking (2 pt)
- [x] Use mouse as an eraser of:
 - a fixed width (1 pt)
 - a adjustable width (2 pt)
- [x] Zoom in and out application working area using keyboard (2 pt)

## Result
Implemented in C#
* The colored button on the top opens a Color Picker Dialog, where the user can change the pen color
* In the width Combo Box you can change the line and eraser width 
* The shapes combo box, here you can choose what type of shape you want to use, so here you can find rectangle, line, ellipse, eraser and bezier curve
(you can draw bezier curve with the mouse, it uses 4 points)
 * And the last combo box is for filling mode, figure can be filled, unfilled or with the gradient
 * Clear button used for clearing the screen
 * Save button used for saving your image to a bitmap ;
#### Total: All mandatory objectives + 10 points (Bonus Objectives)
  
  ## Conclusion
  In this laboratory work, I learned to draw Bezier curves, to write to a bitmap image, to work with GDI primitives and to use Window Forms. Working with C# instead of C++ saved me a lot of time. Finally I obtained a paint like program, that can be used to paint images, like that illustrated below.
