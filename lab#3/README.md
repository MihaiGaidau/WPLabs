# Windows Programming Laboratory Work #3
## Subject
_Basics of Working with Mouse. GDI Primitives. Bezier Curve._

## Mandatory Objectives
- [x] Draw few lines of different colors and weights
- [x] Draw a Bezier curve
- [x] Draw few plane objects (ex. circle, square, pie, polygon...) of different colors, weights, filled and not
- [x] Draw 2 different objects using mouse

## Bonus Objectives

- [x] Draw a custom bitmap image (1 pt) 
- [x] Add a switch (button, select list...) that will change mouse ability to draw objects (2 pt)
- [X] Draw a Bezier curve using mouse (1 pt)
- [x] Fill an object with a gradient (1 pt)
- [x] Delete objects using mouse clicking (2 pt)
- [x] Use mouse as an eraser of:
 - a fixed width (1 pt)
 - a adjustable width (2 pt)
- [] Zoom in and out application working area using keyboard (2 pt)

## Result
Implemented in C#<br>
I chose to perform this laboratory work in C# , becaue is easy to implement methods for painting and working with graphic tools.
I have used different techniques to draw , contruct lines , shapes, fill with colors and different thickness.<br>
The user can use this Paint Application from drawing a line till draw a shape with different size and different color. Also , exist possibility to erase some lines , content from the workspace. After drawing something the user can save the image in some formats. 
Another important function is to open existing image and move, rotate the figure in other place from initial.<br>
I would like to mention some classes that help me easy to draw figures , like: <br>
* PathGeometry - which is contains all power of geometry and using this you can draw line , arc, bezier, polyline segment.
* RotateTransform - it help me to rotate the figure.
#### Total: All mandatory objectives + 10 points (Bonus Objectives)
  
  ## Conclusion
  In this laboratory work I got skills working with C#. Working with this language I remember how useful are contructors and classes.
  Time is very important in developing a application or a project and it is about C# , because here I don't use aprox. 200 lines of code
  for moving the position of some elements or get some objects in my application.<br>
  Learning about C# and increasing the object oriented skills of coding it will help me not only for Windows Programming , but for others   projects  like : unity.
